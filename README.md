## 📖 About The Project

This is the backend REST API for **ArtHub**, an online art marketplace connecting artists and art buyers. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it handles authentication, role-based access control, artwork management, Stripe payments, comments, wishlists, and admin analytics for the [ArtHub frontend](https://github.com/Farhadmu/Arthub-client).

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
- JWT authentication (email/password + Google OAuth), 7-day token expiry
- Role-based access control middleware (`user`, `artist`, `admin`)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Helmet, CORS, and rate limiting (global + auth-specific) for hardened security

### 🖼️ Artwork Management
- Full CRUD on artworks, scoped to the owning artist
- Server-side search, category & price filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Featured artworks and top-artists aggregation endpoints

### 💳 Payments (Stripe)
- Checkout sessions for one-time artwork purchases and recurring subscriptions
- Verified Stripe webhook (`checkout.session.completed`) with raw-body signature validation
- Subscription tier enforcement (Free: 3, Pro: 9, Premium: unlimited purchases)
- Automatic artwork "sold" status and purchase-count tracking on successful payment

### 💬 Engagement
- Purchase-gated comment system — only buyers can comment, with edit/delete for owners
- Wishlist endpoints — add, remove, and list saved artworks per user
- Dummy email notification service — simulated purchase/subscription confirmation emails logged to the console

### 📊 Admin & Analytics
- User management with role updates
- Platform-wide transaction history
- Aggregated analytics: total users, artists, artworks sold, revenue, monthly sales, sales by category
